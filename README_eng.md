## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
You can only install StreamViX locally, on a home server, or on a non-flagged VPN or with smartdns to watch animeunity,  
for the rest, animesaturn and vixsrc work fine also on Huggingface, but they have started banning StreamViX, so use at your own risk.  
For local installations, you always need an https domain to install the addon. Or use a fork of mediaflow proxy EXE on Windows.  
(works only if the PC stays on [https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/mediaflow-proxy_exe/](https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/mediaflow-proxy_exe/))

### üê≥ Docker Compose (Advanced / Self-Hosting)
Ideal if you have a server or VPS and want to manage the addon via Docker.
#### Create the `docker-compose.yml` file
Save the following content in a file called `docker-compose.yml`, or add this compose to your existing file:
```yaml
services:
  streamvix:
    build: [https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/StreamViX.git#main](https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/StreamViX.git#main)
    container_name: streamvix
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '7860:7860'
```
Replace the link with your fork if preferred [https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/StreamViX_MFP.git#main](https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/StreamViX_MFP.git#main)  
TMDB Api KEY, MFP link, MFP password, and the two flags will be managed from the installation page.  
#### Run Docker Compose  
Open a terminal in the directory where you saved the `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command to build and start the container in background:  
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
If updates are available, run:  
```bash
# Stop everything
sudo docker compose down streamvixau
# Remove the specific image
sudo docker rmi streamvix
# Clear build cache
sudo docker builder prune -f
# Rebuild completely without cache
sudo docker compose build --no-cache streamvix
# Start
sudo docker compose up -d streamvix
```
### üíª Method 3: Local Installation (for Experts NOT TESTED)
